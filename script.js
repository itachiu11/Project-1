  // function defined above for each category. You'll need to grab the
  // appropriate HTML element corresponding to the categories div to pass
  // to the appendCategory function.

  // category we care about. Then await the json response, store it in our questionBank
  // object using the storeNewQuestions function we defined earlier. Finally, now that

  // with id of the categoryID. This could mean changing its background color,
  // underlining the text, or really anything visual that helps the user
  // easily recognize which category they currently have selected.
  //
  // You'll also want to make sure you make any prior selected buttons go
  // back to their original styling, so it doesn't look like two are selected!

  // Complete this function so that it triggers a change in category.
  // First, you'll need to get the id from the button element that was
  // targeted in the click event. Then, you can use this id to
  // getQuestionsByCategory.
  //
  // Don't forget to store the categoryID in our variable defined at the top
  // of this file (we'll use that soon in our refacted getNextQuestion function).
  // Also make sure that the button that was clicked appears selected using the
  // highlightCategoryButton function above.
  //

  // TODO: Refactor getNextQuestion to handle iterating through our questionBank
  //
  // You can either refactor the getNextQuestion function we wrote earlier, or complete
  // this one (and remove the old one.) It's up to you!
  //
  // To complete this function, we need to be able to differentiate whether we have a
  // category selected or not. If we don't, we can call the getQuestionRandom function
  // that we've defined earlier (and that our prior version of getNextQuestion
  // automatically called). If we do have a category selected, we can increment
  // our questionIndex each time we grab a question from our questionBank.
  //
  // There's also an edge case that we should handle in this function, what do we do
  // if we get to the end of our list of questions of a specific category? We could
  // start back at the beginning. Or perhaps, tell the user that we're out of questions
  // and they should select a new category. We'll leave that to you for how you'd like
  // to handle it.
  //
  // Write your code below.
